### 4. **Leaderboard System**
**Files:**
- `simple-leaderboard.sql` - Simplified database schema
- `src/components/SimpleLeaderboard.tsx` - Home screen leaderboard component
- **Features:**
  - Automatic updates via database triggers
  - Shows top 5 users
  - Distance/Calories toggle
  - Displays username, sessions, best speed
  - Manual populate function for existing data

### 5. **BLE Cleanup on Logout**
**File:** `src/contexts/BLEContext.tsx`
- **Added `cleanupForLogout()` function** that:
  - Stops active sessions and saves them
  - Disconnects BLE device
  - Stops cloud sync
- **Exported for use in other contexts**

**File:** `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- **Already implements BLE disconnect** on logout
- Uses `BLEService.disconnectDevice()` before sign out
- Creates new guest user after logout

## üìã Navigation Updates Needed

### Add PlayerSelectionScreen to Navigation
You need to add the PlayerSelectionScreen to your navigation stack:

```typescript
// In your navigation file (e.g., App.tsx or navigation/index.tsx)
import PlayerSelectionScreen from './src/screens/PlayerSelectionScreen';

// Add to your navigation stack
<Stack.Screen name="PlayerSelection" component={PlayerSelectionScreen} />
```

### Update Navigation Flow
The recommended flow is:
1. **Login/SignUp** ‚Üí PlayerSelectionScreen
2. **PlayerSelectionScreen** ‚Üí OnboardingScreen  
3. **OnboardingScreen** ‚Üí HomeScreen

Or you can skip PlayerSelection and go directly to Onboarding.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup Required

### 1. Run the Leaderboard SQL
Execute `simple-leaderboard.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor to:
- Create leaderboard table
- Set up automatic triggers
- Add populate function

### 2. Populate Existing Data
After running the SQL, execute:
```sql
SELECT populate_leaderboard();
```

This will fill the leaderboard with data from existing sessions.

## üéØ How It All Works Together

### Player Selection Flow
1. User signs up/logs in
2. Redirected to **PlayerSelectionScreen**
3. Chooses gender (Male/Female) and avatar (male.png/female.png)
4. Saves to `users` table (`gender` and `avatar_gender` fields)
5. Proceeds to **OnboardingScreen** for weight/goals
6. Completes onboarding and goes to **HomeScreen**

### Leaderboard Auto-Update
1. User cycles and session data updates every 5 seconds
2. Database trigger automatically recalculates leaderboard
3. Leaderboard shows top 5 users in HomeScreen
4. Updates in real-time as sessions complete

### BLE Cleanup on Logout
1. User clicks logout
2. AuthContext calls `BLEService.disconnectDevice()`
3. Active session is saved (happens automatically via 5-second sync)
4. BLE connection is terminated
5. User is signed out
6. New guest user is created

### Animation Speed Scaling
- **1 km/h** ‚Üí 1 FPS (very slow)
- **10 km/h** ‚Üí ~35 FPS (medium)
- **20 km/h** ‚Üí 70 FPS (very fast)
- Smooth interpolation between speeds
